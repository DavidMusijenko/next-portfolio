# My portfolio v.0.1

I like the first two slides on desktop - the rest is a mess for now.

## Getting Started

1. The thing is deployed to: https://next-portfolio-dm.vercel.app/
2. If you want to run it locally: npm run dev

## What's next

1. Make it look decent beyond first two slides
2. Clean up css? This thing can be used as a study case "What happens when you don't plan ahead" - I ended up with CSS in two places and in different formats.
3. Rewrite the entire thing without Fullscreen js library?
